Audio Compression Tool

A web-based audio compression tool using MPEG technology. This project allows users to upload an audio file, compress it, and compare the original and compressed file sizes.

## Features
* Upload audio files
* Compress audio files using MPEG technology
* Display original and compressed file sizes
* Play original and compressed audio files

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* MPEG audio compression algorithm (simulated)

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Upload an audio file using the file input
3. Click the "Compress Audio" button to compress the file

## Code Structure
* `index.html`: HTML structure for the audio compression tool
* `styles.css`: CSS styles for the webpage
* `script.js`: JavaScript code for handling audio compression and playback

## Algorithm
The audio compression algorithm used in this project is a simulated version of MPEG technology. The actual implementation would require a library or backend service to handle the compression process.

## Future Enhancements
* Implement actual MPEG audio compression using a library or backend service
* Add support for multiple audio formats
* Improve compression ratio and quality

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please submit pull requests or issues to improve the project.
